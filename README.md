## Overview of the Project
The data of the UFO (unidentified flying objects) with date, city, state, country, shape, and the comment. I created a webpage that displays the title, body paragraph that explains what it is, and the dataset about UFO. Created filter search for the data regarding its components. After clicking the filter table button, the data that satisfied the search criteria will return in the web page. 

## Results
- The front page of the web page looks like the following:

- The search has four filter criterias: date, city, state, and shape
In order to find rows that requires the search criteria, enter the following inputs and click the "filter-table" button.
For example: if I search date as 1/15/2010, and the city as nj. The following result will return in the web page:

## Summary
### Challenges
- Pagination for displaying the initial data is necessary. In this case, it shows all the data points in the front page. 
### Reccommendarions
- Dropdown menu that shows the possibility in the each search box would be beneficial. For example, the dataset has a range of 1/1/2010 - 1/15/2010 in this case. It wouldn't return anything out of this range.
- The filter search section could be displayed on top of the home page. When we click to the button, it should jump to another page and we can do the filtering.
